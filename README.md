# CMM Turbulence

Code for the characteristic mapping method in 2D with particle flow, written in C++ (C) using Nvidia CUDA on Linux.

Even though computational resources grow rapidly, the extremely fine scales in fluid and plasma turbulence remain beyond reach using existing numerical methods. A combination of computational power and ingenious physical insights is usually needed to go beyond the brute force limit. We propose here to develop a novel numerical method, a fully Adaptive Characteristic Mapping Method (ACMM) for evolving the flow map, which yields exponential resolution in linear time. First results for the two-dimensional (2D) incompressible Euler equations show the extremely high resolution capabilities of the scheme obtained by decomposing the flow map and appropriate remapping.

The original version of the Cuda code has been developed by Badal Yadav at McGill University, Montreal, Canada.
Further work on the code has been done by Thibault Oujia, Nicolas Saber and Julius Bergmann at I2M, Aix-Marseille Universit√©, France.

# Prerequesites

This code is developed to be built and run on Linux machines. In addition, an installation of Nvidia Cuda together with a featured graphics card is required. To properly install Cuda on your system, Nvidia provides a helpful guide for installation: "https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html".

# Compiling, building and running

1) Copy the whole repository to your local machine.
   
2) Prepare the execution of the code on your local machine:
   
   Initialize files:
   - clone the repository to your machine, all code is located in the Cuda-CMM folder.

   Checking initial conditions:

   - Check grid_coarse and grid_fine in Cuda-CMM/src/simulation/settings.cu to work with your GPU memory, the memory usage can be tested while the code is running with the command 'nvidia-smi'.
   - Change mem_RAM_GPU_remaps in Cuda-CMM/src/simulation/settings.cu to a suitable number for your GPU memory. This value defines the amount of remappings to be saved on the GPU in MB and should only account for a fraction of the actual memory to give more space to other variables.
   - Change mem_RAM_CPU_remaps in Cuda-CMM/src/simulation/settings.cu to match your CPU memory in MB. This value can be chosen arbitrarily high in comparison to your machines CPU RAM.
   - Set the initial condition in Cuda-CMM/src/simulation/settings.cu.

   Makefile:
   - Change all -arch flags in the make-file to match your GPU architecture. This specifies the name of the NVIDIA GPU architecture that the CUDA files will be compiled for. Further information regarding the architecture can be found at "https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html#gpu-feature-list". Choose a version matching your architecture name.
   - check that nvcc is installed in the right directory in "/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc".
   - compile the code in a shell by changing into the directory and running 'make' or 'make all'.
     check for errors, if not listed, please provide them as an issue along with the given error stack.
   
3) Running the code:
   - Run the code in a shell by executing 'SimulationCuda2d.out'.
   - Variables can be set at command line level by adding pairs in the form of "COMMAND=VALUE", the name of the commands correspond to the actual variable name in the settings file. A huge variety of information regarding the meaning and values can be found in the setPresets-function in Cuda-CMM/src/simulation/settings.cu.
   - Cuda errors are quite common, any furher error however should be reported as an issue along with the error stack.

# Restrictions on code for different machines

Difference between cluster and machine computations:
The code is highly dependent on the GPU memory. This limits the usage on personal machines.

# Other notices

Some more details, maybe team details?

# Code structure

Maybe some comments on what parts should be changeable and which are mainly set

Setup a Post-folder for all python post-processing?

# Literature references and Research project

The open access code has been developed in the context of the ongoing ANR project "CM2E" (http://lmfa.ec-lyon.fr/spip.php?article1807) and is used in this framework.
It is based on the original version of the cuda code, developed by Badal Yadav at McGill University, Canada.
